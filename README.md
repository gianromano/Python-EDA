Project Brief Context

The digital world is evolving, and so are Vanguard’s clients. Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. The critical question was: Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?

Control Group (A): Clients interacted with Vanguard’s traditional online process.
Test Group (B): Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.

Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

Completion Rate: The proportion of users who reach the final ‘confirm’ step.

Time Spent on Each Step (TSES): The average duration users spend on each step.

Error Rates: If there’s a step where users go back to a previous step, it may indicate confusion or an error. You should consider moving from a later step to an earlier one as an error.
